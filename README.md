# BAC-Calculator-Plus
This application measures an individual's blood alcohol content (BAC). 
By entering your information you can find an accurate approximation of their BAC.

This app features an iPhone version of the traditional BAC card as well as an advanced BAC estiamtor that factors in the brand of alcohol consumed.

Additionally, there is a map that finds your current location and tells you where you are in case you would like to call a cab. Cab companies, fast food establishments and local bars (and their phone numbers) may be added to your map upon selecting their respective buttons.

This application is for educational and recreational use only. You should never drink and drive and always be careful when consuming alcohol.
